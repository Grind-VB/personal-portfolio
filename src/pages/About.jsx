      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I'm a passionate and self-driven developer with a strong foundation in <span className="font-medium">frontend development</span> and <span className="font-medium">artificial intelligence</span>. With a background in Data Science and AI, I focus on building intuitive, user-first interfaces that blend functionality with visual harmony.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My journey began with an eagerness to bridge the gap between humans and technology, and since then, I’ve cultivated a love for creating <span className="italic">accessible, responsive, and inclusive web experiences</span>. I work primarily with technologies like <span className="font-medium">React, TailwindCSS, and Flutter</span> on the frontend, and have hands-on experience applying machine learning concepts to real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Recently, I’ve been exploring the intersection of AI and user experience through projects that involve real-time object detection, productivity-enhancing tools, and multilingual learning platforms. I believe in building solutions that are not only technically sound but also emotionally engaging and ethically aware.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Outside of coding, I enjoy immersing myself in Japanese culture, learning new languages, and staying active through regular workouts. I'm currently on a mission to grow as a full-stack developer, contribute to impactful projects, and eventually build products that empower people around the world.
